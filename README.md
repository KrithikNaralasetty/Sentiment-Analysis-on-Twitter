## How the Project Works

Once all the necessary files are built/created, the model is used to analyze the tweet by 
mapping it to a set of key words and determining its sentiment as positive, negative or neutral.
We can aditionally provide the recent number of tweets to analyze. This gives us a set of sentiment values for each group of tweets,
allowing us to determine the kind of influencer the account is.
